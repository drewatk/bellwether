          <p>


            New-View Solutions contracts with Construction and Architecture firms, allowing them to transform their existing designs into virtual reality experiences to show to their clients. Our service takes their designs, in standard CAD software format, and construct
            a demo program that helps their clients envision their designs to make changes before construction starts. Businesses use New-View Solutions to save time and money because of the unique advantages that virtual reality allows. VR lets people
            experience what it is like to walk through an environment and see what it is like, before the building is built. This is a more immersive and realistic experience for the client than seeing 2D blueprints or architectural renderings. It saves
            money because the home builders are able to give better feedback to the designers, so that costly changes don’t have to be made later in construction.
